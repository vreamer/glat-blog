**Glat**: Goal of Life = Action + Time -> Knowledge

![Glat Menu](/img/glat/menu-default.png)

**Goal** is something you want but don't have yet
In order to achieve your **goal**, or in other words, to obtain the desired things, one needs to take **actions** to change the current situation. However, it's easier said than done. It's often difficult to map out the exact route from the current situation to the desired goal. Therefore, when we experiment with different actions, we obtain **knowledge** that is unique to us. That knowledge is also valuable to our **friends**. 

### Linear Thinking in a Non-Linear World
We live in a non-linear world where our inherited tools are linear. Hence, we struggle to describe our world using these linear tools, like language and time.
* Fragmented Time and Information
* Confusion in Collaboration
* Information loss in Linear Sharing

### Attempt to Describe Non-Linear World
For people who use **Glat** by itself, here are four ways to help increase efficiency
* Breakdown (pyramid)
* Prioritize (2 by 2)
* Schedule (time)
* Dangling (fragments)

### Breakdown

### Share in Graph
To make Glat more powerful, we can collaborate with friends in following ways:
* Organize relationships
* Share goals/actions/knowledge with friends
* Collaboration on same goal
