**Glat**: Goal of Life = Action + Time -> Knowledge

**Goal** is something you want but don't have yet
In order to achieve your **goal**, or in other words, to obtain the desired things, one needs to take **actions** to change the current situation. However, it's easier said than done. It's often difficult to map out the exact route from the current situation to the desired goal. Therefore, when we experiment with different actions, we obtain **knowledge** that is unique to us. That knowledge is also valuable to our **friends**. 

For people who use **Glat** by itself, here are four ways to help increase efficiency
* Breakdown
* Prioritize
* Schedule
* Dangling

To make Glat more powerful, we can collaborate with friends in following ways:
* Organize relationships
* Share goals/actions/knowledge with friends
* Collaboration on same goal
